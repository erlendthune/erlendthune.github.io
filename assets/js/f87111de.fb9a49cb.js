Provided you have a bluetooth smart heart rate sensor connected, the app will use synthetic speech to announce your heart rate as often as you like. You can choose whether you want the reading to be heartbeats per minute or the percentage of your maximum heart rate. The synthetic speech takes away the need of looking at a display to know your heart rate. Instead you can use your ears to get this information and concentrate your eyes elsewhere."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["You can download the app here: ",(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/corrate/id1014082292",children:"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/corrate/id1014082292"})]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"You will find many articles describing how to do heart rate training on the internet, by searching for \u201dHeart Rate Training\u201d for example. The main idea is that you get different results depending on what heart rate you have compared to your maximum heart rate. When competing, staying in an elevated heart rate zone too long can decrease your performance. One of the advantages with the HRT app is that you can select how often you want to be alerted and be able to adapt your performance immediately. The app is easy to use and is as suitable for professional athletes as for amateurs. The app also features a customizable heart rate recovery mechanism. Measure how fast your heart rate drops after training. It is normally considered to be a sign of improving physical condition if your heart rate drops faster."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The app is free.
